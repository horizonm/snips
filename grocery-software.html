<p>CATAPULT goes beyond omni-channel and it’s more than unified commerce. Unified Transaction Logic™ is the soul of our seamless system. It connects all critical areas of retail operation in real time: inventory &amp; supply chain, reporting &amp; analytics, loyalty &amp; marketing, pos, and payments all work in unison.</p>
<p>Checkout lanes, self-checkout terminals, deli scales, pharmacy, fuel, web orders, and even smartphone apps all work as one. CATAPULT cuts costs and eliminates the points of failure commonly found on piecemeal-built systems. Say goodbye to silos and hello to the future.</p>
<h2>Unified Transaction Logic</h2>
<p>Unified Transaction Logic is a solution to the problem of piecemeal-built, siloed-commerce platforms. Silos are complex and expensive. Many companies feel trapped in these configurations, relying on a multitude of third party vendors who will shift blame and avoid responsibility at the first sign of technical trouble. Worst of all, change to one silo creates domino effects onto others, causing systemic friction, making the enterprise less agile, which means less adaptable to emerging opportunities.</p>
<img alt="unified transaction logic" src="https://www.ecrs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/catapult-unified-transaction-logic.png" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto; width: 800px; height: auto;">
<br>
<p>Unified Transaction Logic breaks through the dysfunction, allowing the same transaction logic to be shared throughout the enterprise, no matter how complex, where, how, and when customers want to transact. And, it can be done through one single, reliable technology partner.</p>
